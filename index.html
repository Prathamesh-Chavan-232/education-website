          Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
          such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character
          traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
          role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from
          indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
          improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
          definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
          also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process:
          the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.
          Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one
          generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
          encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed
          for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills. Types of
          education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal
          education. Formal education takes place in education and training
          institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives,
          and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In
          most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and
          commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary
          school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
          alternative to formal education. and learning is typically guided by a
          teacher.

          But, my family told me: “you can’t quit now, you’re almost there. Just
          try it once more!” You’ve probably heard that before too, right? So, I
          got back on that bike. I didn’t want to, but you just need to power
          through and face your challenges head-on. Sure enough, that was the
          first time that I rode that bike without any help. After that, I was
          so glad I kept moving forward and that I never gave up. Now, that
          probably wasn’t the motivational speech that you expected when you
          clicked on this article, but it’s evidence that we can do so much more
          than we think we’re capable of when we’re spurred on by others. And
          that’s exactly why we’ve created this article – we’ve listed all of
          our favorite motivational speeches here, because we already know how
          much more you can achieve with a little bit of extra motivation.
